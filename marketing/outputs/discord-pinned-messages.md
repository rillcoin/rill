## Welcome to RillCoin

RillCoin uses progressive concentration decay to prevent whale accumulation. The more you hoard, the more flows back to miners. A cryptocurrency designed for circulation, not concentration.

**"Wealth should flow like water."**

---

**What is this project?**

RillCoin is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency with a built-in concentration decay mechanism that redistributes dormant holdings to active miners. It is currently in active development. The testnet is live and open to participation.

---

**Getting started:**

1. Read the rules → #rules
2. Verify your account → #roles-and-verification
3. Check the FAQ if you want to understand decay before anything else → #faq
4. Join the conversation → #general

---

**Security reminder:**
No Core Team member or Moderator will ever DM you first to offer support, airdrops, or giveaways. If someone DMs you claiming to be from the team, it is a scam. Report it using the `/report` command or open a ticket in #create-ticket.

**Protect yourself from DM spam:**
Go to Server Settings (click the server name) → Privacy Settings → disable "Allow direct messages from server members." This prevents strangers in this server from messaging you directly.
```

## What is concentration decay?

RillCoin implements progressive concentration decay. When a wallet's balance exceeds defined thresholds, the portion above each threshold decays over time and flows into the mining pool, where it is redistributed to active miners.

The larger your balance, the faster the excess decays. This is not a penalty — it is a circulation incentive. Wealth should flow like water, not pool in reservoirs.

### #faq — Pinned Message 1 of 3

```
## Frequently Asked Questions

---

**What is RillCoin?**
RillCoin is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency with a built-in concentration decay mechanism that redistributes dormant holdings to active miners. It is designed around a principle of circulation over concentration. The project is open-source and currently in testnet.

---

**What is concentration decay?**
When a wallet's balance exceeds defined thresholds, the portion above each threshold decays over time and flows into the decay pool, where it is redistributed to active miners. The larger your balance, the faster the excess decays. This is not a penalty — it is a circulation incentive. Wealth should flow like water, not pool in reservoirs.

---

**How does decay work technically?**
Decay is computed using a sigmoid curve applied to balances above defined concentration thresholds. Each threshold tier applies a progressively higher decay rate to the excess balance. Decay is applied per block and expressed as a fraction of the effective balance above the threshold. The decayed amount flows into the decay pool and is distributed to miners as part of the block reward.

---

**What are the decay thresholds?**
The specific threshold values and decay rates are defined in the protocol constants. See the technical documentation for the current mainnet parameters: [docs.rillcoin.com/protocol/decay](URL_PLACEHOLDER). Testnet parameters may differ from mainnet parameters during the testing phase.

---

**What is "effective balance"?**
Your effective balance is the portion of your wallet balance that is not subject to active decay — the amount below the first decay threshold. Holdings above the thresholds are subject to decay at rates defined by the protocol.
```

---

### #faq — Pinned Message 2 of 3

```
**How do I run a node?**
The RillCoin node software is available on GitHub: [github.com/rillcoin/rill](URL_PLACEHOLDER). Full node setup documentation is at [docs.rillcoin.com/node](URL_PLACEHOLDER). For questions and troubleshooting, use #node-operators.

Basic requirements: a machine with sufficient disk space for the chain, a stable internet connection, and the ability to open the required ports. Specific hardware recommendations are in the documentation.

---

**How do I get testnet coins?**
Use the faucet in #faucet. Run the command `/faucet <your-testnet-address>`. You can request once every 24 hours per account. Your testnet address must be in the correct RillCoin testnet address format — the bot will reject addresses that do not match.

On successful delivery, you will receive the Testnet Participant role automatically.

---

**What is the roadmap?**
The current public roadmap is at [rillcoin.com/roadmap](URL_PLACEHOLDER). In brief: the project is in active testnet. Mainnet launch follows once the protocol is stable and audited. Governance tooling is planned post-mainnet.

---

**Is there a token sale or ICO?**
No. There is no token sale, no ICO, and no pre-mine. RillCoin is distributed exclusively through proof-of-work mining. Any offer to sell you RillCoin before it is mineable on mainnet is a scam.

---

**How do I contribute to the project?**
Read the contribution guide at [docs.rillcoin.com/contributing](URL_PLACEHOLDER) and the open issues on GitHub: [github.com/rillcoin/rill](URL_PLACEHOLDER). Discuss your approach in #development before opening a large pull request. All contributions must pass `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` and `cargo test --workspace`.

### #price-and-markets — Pinned Message 1 of 1

```
## #price-and-markets — Ground Rules

This channel exists so market discussion stays out of #general. It is a designated space, not an endorsement of any particular price view.

---

**What is permitted:**
- Discussion of exchange listings, trading pairs, and market mechanics
- Questions about how the concentration decay mechanism interacts with market dynamics
- Links to price data from established sources
- Factual discussion of market events

**What is not permitted:**
- Price predictions stated as certainties
- Financial advice of any kind ("you should buy/sell")
- Coordinated buy or sell language — this server does not organize market activity
- Banned words: moon, lambo, pump, dump, gem, ape, degen, wagmi, ngmi, diamond hands, paper hands, shill

---

**Standard reminder:**
Nothing posted in this channel constitutes financial advice. RillCoin does not make price predictions or financial promises. Participation in any cryptocurrency involves risk. Make your own decisions.

---

Repeated violations of these ground rules will result in removal from this channel or the server under the standard escalation policy in #rules.

---

## TECHNICAL

---

### #protocol — Pinned Message 1 of 2

```
## Concentration Decay — Protocol Explainer

This is the differentiating mechanism of RillCoin. Read this before asking decay questions.

---

**The core idea**
RillCoin implements progressive concentration decay. Wallet balances above defined thresholds decay over time. The decayed amount flows into the decay pool, which is distributed to miners as part of the block reward.

This is a circulation incentive built into the protocol itself — not a fee, not a tax, not a burn. It is a property of holding a large balance.

---

**How the decay rate is determined**
Decay uses a sigmoid curve applied to the balance above each threshold. The sigmoid curve means:
- Small amounts above a threshold decay slowly
- Large amounts above a threshold decay faster
- The decay rate increases progressively across tiers — higher thresholds apply higher rates

This prevents abrupt cliffs while still creating meaningful pressure against large concentration.

---

**What "effective balance" means**
Your effective balance is the portion of your holdings below the first decay threshold. It does not decay. Holdings above the thresholds are subject to decay at the rates defined by the protocol constants.

---

**The decay pool**
Decayed amounts accumulate in the decay pool per block. The pool balance is distributed to miners as part of the block reward for that block. Miners with more hash power receive a proportionally larger share.
```

---

### #protocol — Pinned Message 2 of 2

```
**Arithmetic and precision**
All consensus math uses integer arithmetic with fixed-point precision at 10^8 (similar to Bitcoin's satoshi precision). No floating-point arithmetic is used in the protocol. This ensures deterministic results across all implementations.

---

**Proof of work**
RillCoin uses proof-of-work consensus. Block headers are hashed using SHA-256. The current testnet uses a simplified PoW implementation; the mainnet protocol uses RandomX to provide ASIC resistance.

---

**Fee structure**
A minimum fee is required for all transactions. The minimum fee is defined in the protocol constants. Fees are distributed to miners alongside the decay pool distribution.

---

**Where to find the formal specification**
Full protocol specification: [docs.rillcoin.com/protocol](URL_PLACEHOLDER)
Whitepaper (decay mechanism section): [docs.rillcoin.com/whitepaper#decay](URL_PLACEHOLDER)
Source of truth for constants: `rill-core/src/constants.rs` on [GitHub](URL_PLACEHOLDER)

---

**Discussion guidelines for this channel**
High-signal conversation is expected here. If you are asking a basic question, check #faq first. If you are making a technical claim, link your reasoning. Threads are encouraged for extended analysis.

### #node-operators — Pinned Message 1 of 2

```
## Running a RillCoin Node — Quick Start

Full documentation: [docs.rillcoin.com/node](URL_PLACEHOLDER)

---

**Prerequisites:**
- Operating system: Linux (Ubuntu 22.04+ recommended), macOS, or Windows (WSL2)
- Disk space: Minimum 20 GB free (testnet); mainnet requirements will be higher
- RAM: Minimum 2 GB
- Network: Stable connection; ability to open inbound TCP port (default: 30333)
- Rust toolchain: stable, MSRV 1.85+ (not required if using pre-built binaries)

---

**Installation (from source):**
```
git clone https://github.com/rillcoin/rill
cd rill
cargo build --release --bin rill-node
```

**Running the node:**
```
./target/release/rill-node --network testnet
```

For full flag reference:
```
./target/release/rill-node --help
```

---

**Connecting to testnet:**
The testnet bootstrap peers are listed in the documentation: [docs.rillcoin.com/testnet/peers](URL_PLACEHOLDER)

Your node will begin syncing from the genesis block. Initial sync time depends on your connection speed and the current chain height.
```

---

### #node-operators — Pinned Message 2 of 2

```
**Mining (testnet):**
Mining is supported on testnet. To enable mining, provide a wallet address to receive rewards:
```
./target/release/rill-node --network testnet --mine --wallet <your-testnet-address>
```

The miner competes on the current PoW target. On testnet, the RandomX implementation is active. ASIC mining is not advantageous due to the memory-hard algorithm.

---

**Common issues:**

*Node won't connect to peers*
- Verify that your firewall allows inbound connections on the node port
- Check that the bootstrap peer addresses in your config are current — see [docs.rillcoin.com/testnet/peers](URL_PLACEHOLDER)

*Sync is stalled*
- Check the `#testnet-status` channel for network health
- Restart the node with `--resync` flag if blocks are not advancing after 30 minutes

*Decay calculation looks wrong*
- Decay is applied per block. If you are checking balances mid-block, the displayed balance may not yet reflect the latest decay application. Wait for block confirmation.

---

**Reporting node issues:**
If you encounter a bug, use the template in #bug-reports. Include your node version (`rill-node --version`), OS, and the full error output.

For configuration questions, ask in this channel. For suspected bugs, use #bug-reports.
```

---

## TESTNET

---

### #testnet-general — Pinned Message 1 of 1

```
## Testnet Participation

The RillCoin testnet is live and open to the public. Your participation matters — the more nodes, wallets, and transactions running on testnet, the more confidently the protocol can be validated before mainnet.

---

**How to get started:**

1. Get the node software: [github.com/rillcoin/rill](URL_PLACEHOLDER)
2. Follow the setup guide: [docs.rillcoin.com/testnet](URL_PLACEHOLDER)
3. Get testnet coins from the faucet in #faucet
4. Run transactions, test the decay mechanism, and report anything unexpected

---

**Roles you can earn:**
- **Testnet Participant** — Automatically assigned when you receive faucet coins
- **Bug Hunter** — Manually awarded for confirmed Medium+ severity bug reports

---

**Channels to use:**
- Setup questions → #node-operators
- Bug reports → #bug-reports (use the template)
- Wallet address sharing for testing → #testnet-wallets
- Testnet coins → #faucet
- Live network status → #testnet-status

---

**Important:** Testnet coins have no monetary value. Testnet parameters (thresholds, decay rates, block time) may differ from the final mainnet parameters. Do not use mainnet wallet addresses on testnet.

Full testnet documentation: [docs.rillcoin.com/testnet](URL_PLACEHOLDER)
```

---

### #bug-reports — Pinned Message 1 of 1

**Node version:** [Output of `rill-node --version`]
**OS:** [e.g., Ubuntu 22.04, macOS 14.3, Windows 11 WSL2]
**Network:** [testnet / mainnet]

**Steps to reproduce:**
1.
2.
3.

**Expected behavior:**
[What you expected to happen]

**Actual behavior:**
[What actually happened]

**Logs / error output:**
[Paste relevant log lines here, wrapped in code blocks]

**Severity (your assessment):**
[ ] Low — cosmetic or minor inconvenience
[ ] Medium — incorrect behavior, workaround exists
[ ] High — significant malfunction, no workaround
[ ] Critical — data loss, security issue, consensus failure
```

---

**After submitting:**
A Core Team member will reply in your thread with a triage status. Confirmed Medium+ bugs earn the **Bug Hunter** role. If your bug is linked to a GitHub issue, the issue number will be posted in your thread.

**Security vulnerabilities:** Do not post publicly. Email [security@rillcoin.com](URL_PLACEHOLDER) instead.
```

---

### #faucet — Pinned Message 1 of 1

```
## Testnet Faucet

The faucet distributes testnet RillCoin for development and testing.

---

**How to request:**
Run this command in this channel:
```
/faucet <your-testnet-address>
```

Replace `<your-testnet-address>` with your RillCoin testnet wallet address.

---

**Rate limits:**
- One request per Discord account per 24 hours
- One request per wallet address per 24 hours

Both limits apply independently. Creating multiple Discord accounts to bypass the rate limit will result in a ban.

---

**Address format:**
The bot validates address format before processing. Addresses that do not match the RillCoin testnet address format will be rejected. Do not use mainnet addresses here.

To generate a testnet wallet address, see the wallet documentation: [docs.rillcoin.com/wallet](URL_PLACEHOLDER)

---

**After your request:**
The bot will confirm receipt and post the expected transaction time. Once the transaction is confirmed on chain, you will automatically receive the **Testnet Participant** role.

If the faucet does not respond within 10 minutes, check #testnet-status for network health. If the network is healthy and the faucet is unresponsive, report it in #support-general.

---

**Testnet coins have no monetary value.**
```

---

## GOVERNANCE

---

### #governance-general — Pinned Message 1 of 1

```
## Governance — Current Status

RillCoin governance is currently in an advisory phase. There is no on-chain voting yet. This channel exists to build the culture and practice of community governance before the formal mechanisms are deployed.

---

**What governance means here, right now:**
- Community members propose and discuss changes to the protocol, parameters, and community direction
- The Core Team reads this channel and takes community input seriously
- No vote here is binding — the Core Team makes final decisions during this phase
- This will change as the project matures and formal governance tooling is deployed

---

**How to participate:**
- Post your thoughts on protocol direction, parameter choices, or process questions here
- To submit a formal proposal, use #proposals with the structured format
- Governance Ping: opt in via `/role` in #bot-commands to receive pings when new proposals open

---

**Access:**
This channel is open to **Contributor** role and above. To earn Contributor, see the requirements in #roles-and-verification.

---

**What comes next:**
On-chain voting is planned post-mainnet. When snapshot.org or on-chain governance launches, results and links will appear in #voting. This channel will transition from advisory to participatory at that point.

Questions about the governance roadmap → [docs.rillcoin.com/governance](URL_PLACEHOLDER)
```

---

### #proposals — Pinned Message 1 of 1

```
## Proposal Template and Guidelines

Use this format for every formal proposal. Posts that do not follow the structure will be asked to revise before discussion begins.

This is a forum channel. Each proposal is a separate post with a title.

---

**Proposal template:**

```
**RCP-[number]: [Short title]**

**Summary**
[2–4 sentences. What are you proposing and why?]

**Motivation**
[What problem does this solve? What is the current behavior and why is it insufficient?]

**Specification**
[Precise description of the proposed change. For protocol changes, include: affected constants or parameters, the proposed new values, and the mathematical or logical reasoning. For process changes, describe the new procedure step by step.]

**Drawbacks**
[What are the honest downsides or risks of this proposal? This section is required. Proposals that do not acknowledge tradeoffs are not credible.]

**Alternatives considered**
[What other approaches did you consider and why did you not propose them?]

**Open questions**
[What remains unresolved? What feedback are you specifically seeking?]
```

---

**Numbering:** Use the next sequential RCP (RillCoin Proposal) number. Check existing proposals to avoid duplicates.

**Discussion:** Use the thread on your proposal post. Keep top-level discussion in the thread, not in #governance-general.

**Status:** Core Team will add a status tag to proposals: Draft → Under Review → Accepted / Rejected / Deferred.
```

## Getting Help

This channel is for public support questions. Use it for wallet setup, sync issues, decay calculation questions, and general troubleshooting.

---

**Before posting, check these resources:**
- FAQ → #faq
- Protocol documentation → [docs.rillcoin.com](URL_PLACEHOLDER)
- Node setup guide → [docs.rillcoin.com/node](URL_PLACEHOLDER)
- #node-operators for node-specific questions
- #bug-reports if you believe you have found a bug (use the template)

---

**When posting a support question, include:**
- What you are trying to do
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Your node or wallet version, if relevant
- Your operating system, if relevant
- Any error messages (paste the full text or a screenshot)

The more context you provide, the faster someone can help.

---

**For private support** (if your question involves wallet addresses, keys, or sensitive account information):
Use #create-ticket to open a private thread with the support team. Do not post private keys or seed phrases anywhere in this server — not in this channel, not in a ticket.

---

**Security reminder:**
No one from the Core Team will DM you first to offer support. If someone DMs you claiming to be support and asking for your seed phrase, wallet address, or any credentials — it is a scam. Report it using `/report`.
