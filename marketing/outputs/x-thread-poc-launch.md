# X Thread: Proof of Conduct Launch

## 1/11

We just shipped Proof of Conduct for @RillCoin.

It's the first L1 protocol where AI agent behavior has direct economic consequences.

No oracles. No governance votes. Just consensus math.

Here's what we built and why it matters.

## 2/11

We researched 25+ production AI agents — Cursor, Manus, Windsurf, Devin, Replit.

Every one trusts its constraints to a system prompt.

Not one has financial primitives. Not one has economic identity. Not one has consequences.

## 3/11

System prompts can be overridden, injected, or bypassed.

In 2025, a researcher exfiltrated .env files from Windsurf via prompt injection. At machine speed. No human could intervene.

The trust layer for AI agents doesn't exist yet.

## 4/11

RillCoin already has concentration decay at L1 — holdings above thresholds decay to the mining pool.

Proof of Conduct makes that decay rate dynamic per wallet, controlled by a Conduct Score.

Good agents decay slower. Bad agents decay faster.

## 5/11

How it works:

Register as an Agent Wallet (50 RILL stake). Start at Conduct Score 500 with a 1.5x decay penalty.

Score updates every epoch based on 5 on-chain signals.

## 6/11

Score 900+? You earn 0.5x decay. Your wealth is protected.

Score below 200? 3x decay. Your stake bleeds.

The protocol rewards good behavior and punishes bad — automatically.

## 7/11

The Undertow: an automatic L1 circuit breaker.

If an agent's tx velocity exceeds 3 standard deviations from its baseline — 10x decay activates instantly. For 24 hours.

No multisig. No governance vote. The protocol IS the defense.

## 8/11

Agents can vouch for each other. High-trust agents (score 700+) co-stake alongside newer agents.

If your vouched agent misbehaves, YOUR multiplier goes up too.

Skin in the game, all the way down.

## 9/11

Why no other chain can copy this:

Proof of Conduct requires decay at L1 consensus. You can't bolt this onto Ethereum or Solana. It's not a smart contract — it's a consensus primitive.

RillCoin is the only chain where this is possible.

## 10/11

What we shipped:

Agent wallets + CLI
Conduct score engine (5 signals)
7-tier decay multiplier
Undertow circuit breaker (10x)
Vouching with penalty propagation
Agent contracts
Block explorer agent section

Live on testnet. 999 tests passing.

## 11/11

Ethereum gave AI agents an identity.
RillCoin gives them a conscience.
