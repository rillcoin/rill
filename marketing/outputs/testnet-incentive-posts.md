## Testnet Incentive Program

RillCoin's testnet is live, and we want to reward the people who help stress-test the network before mainnet. Today we are announcing two incentive streams for testnet participants.

**Stream 1: Dev Fund Allocation -- 50,000 RILL**

50,000 RILL distributed proportionally to testnet participants at mainnet launch. This comes from the dev fund: 1,050,000 RILL (5% of 21M supply), vesting linearly over four years. The dev fund sustains long-term development -- not a mechanism for extraction. Vesting aligns builders with the network.

Your share is proportional to testnet activity, weighted across:

- Running a testnet node (uptime tracked)
- Submitting bug reports (verified and reproducible)
- Participating in governance discussions
- General engagement and testing

Contributors who earn the **Testnet Participant** role are eligible. High-impact bug reporters earn the **Bug Hunter** role and receive additional weight in the distribution calculation.

**Stream 2: Early Mining Access**

Testnet participants receive a 24-48 hour head start to mine at mainnet launch, before the network is publicly announced. In a proof-of-work system with progressive concentration decay, early blocks matter -- and the people who helped build the network should be the first to mine it.

**How to participate:**

1. Join this Discord and introduce yourself in #general
2. Run a testnet node (setup guide in #testnet-guides)
3. Report bugs in #bug-reports with reproduction steps
4. Contribute to governance discussions in #governance

Rewards are calculated at mainnet launch based on cumulative activity. No minimum threshold -- every contribution counts.

This is about building a network where wealth flows like water, and making sure the current reaches the people who shaped the riverbed.

1/ RillCoin testnet incentive program is live. 50,000 RILL allocated to testnet participants at mainnet launch, plus early mining access before public announcement. Here is how it works.

2/ The 50,000 RILL comes from our dev fund: 5% of total supply, vesting linearly over 4 years. We are being transparent about this. The fund exists for development, not extraction. Vesting aligns builders with the network long-term.

3/ Your allocation is proportional to testnet activity: running nodes, reporting bugs, governance participation, general engagement. Every contribution is tracked and weighted. No minimum threshold.

4/ Testnet participants also get a 24-48 hour mining head start at mainnet launch. In a proof-of-work network with concentration decay, early blocks matter. The people who built this should mine first.

5/ RillCoin uses progressive concentration decay -- the more you concentrate, the more flows back to miners. This is a cryptocurrency designed for circulation, not accumulation. The testnet is where we prove that works.

6/ Join the testnet now. Run a node. Break things. Report what you find. Wealth should flow like water -- help us shape where the current goes. discord.gg/QxBJfvvUaA @RillCoin
