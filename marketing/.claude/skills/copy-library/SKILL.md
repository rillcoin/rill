# RillCoin Copy Library

## Core Messaging

- **Tagline:** "Wealth should flow like water."
- **Elevator pitch:** "RillCoin uses progressive concentration decay to prevent whale accumulation. The more you hoard, the more flows back to miners. A cryptocurrency designed for circulation, not concentration."
- **Technical one-liner:** "A proof-of-work cryptocurrency with a built-in concentration decay mechanism that redistributes dormant holdings to active miners."
