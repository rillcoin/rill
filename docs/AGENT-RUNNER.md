# Running Rill Agents with Claude Code

## Launch: cd into crate dir, run `claude`
## Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): Core types → Decay engine → Integration tests
## Agents communicate via: trait interfaces, memory files, you (orchestrator)
## After each session: check memory file updated, cargo check, cargo test
## Cost: Sonnet for implementation, Opus for test/security agent and architecture
